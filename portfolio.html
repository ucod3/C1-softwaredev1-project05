        <h2>Oshawa Valley Botanical Garden</h2>
        <p>At "Unlock Your Web Development Potential," we're proud of our portfolio of web development projects. One of our most successful projects was the development of an interactive mobile web app for the Oshawa Valley Botanical Garden.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        The app was designed to address the problem of the garden lacking an efficient guidance system for visitors, which resulted in confusion and a poor visitor experience. Our team collaborated with the City of Oshawa to conduct research and analyze the needs of the garden and its visitors. Using HTML5, CSS3, SVG animations, and vanilla JavaScript, we developed an interactive web app that provided visitors with an easy-to-use guidance system.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the app easily accessible, we placed a QR code at the park that visitors could scan with their mobile devices to access the web app. Our team played a key role in animating the guidance system using the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) library.
        </p>
        <p>
          The completed web app was presented to City Council and key stakeholders, demonstrating its effectiveness. We were thrilled with the success of this project and the positive impact it had on the visitor experience at the Oshawa Valley Botanical Garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this project, we have developed other web development projects that showcase our skills in problem identification, research, collaboration, development of software using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and presentation of results to stakeholders. We invite you to check out our portfolio and see what we can do for you.
